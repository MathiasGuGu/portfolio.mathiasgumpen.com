##### Introduction

Holidaze is a booking site for noroff students. It was given as a final exam the 4th semester at Noroff.
The main purpose of the app is to give the user the ability to book, view and search for hotels.
Although fictional, the app is built with real-world clients and scenarios in mind.
When we were given the task, we were given a design and a set of requirements that we had to follow.
These requirements were the basis for the Grade we would be given, so they were very important to follow.
The feautures are the requirenmets we had to follow.

##### Challenges

One challenge that stood out to me and other students I believe was the functional calender component.
This component was supposed to showcase all available and unavalable dates for a venue.
When creating this component it was not only important that the user understodd what dates were available, but also that the user could book a date from the very same calender.
I opted for a pop-up modal that would show the user the available dates and let the user book a date from the same modal.
