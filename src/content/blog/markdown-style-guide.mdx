# Markdown Style Sheet

Writing a blog with markdown can be fun. It is easy, reliable and honestly a pretty good learning experience.
But now we need styling, because without good styling no one will read it, right?

#### First off, Headers

Headers are locking points. It is what a user reads first when they scroll and ultimately decides if they are interested.
So, make sure your headers are big, bold and beautiful.

# This is a H1

## This is a H2

### This is a H3

#### This is a H4

##### This is a H5

What more do we need? we have titles and we have text, so we are good right? No, there is so much more.
Lets have a look at Code blocks

#### Code Blocks

Code blocks are a good way to show code snippets. It is important to have a good style for code blocks.
Here is an example of a code block showcasing a simple function in JavaScript.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b; // [!code --]
}
```

Syntax highlighting depends on the language you use for your code block.
In this example were using Javascript so we get relevant highlighting on keywords.

you can specify the language by adding the language name after the three backticks.
For example, to specify the language as JavaScript, you would write ```javascript.

You can also use other languages like CSS, HTML, Python, bash, etc.

now we have to be good right? NO!

#### Lists

Lists are a good way to show a list of items. It can be ordered or unordered.
Here is an example of an unordered list.

- Item 1
- Item 2

Here is an example of an ordered list.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

#### Links

Links are a good way to link to other pages or websites. Here is an example of a link to the [Astro website](https://astro.build/).
